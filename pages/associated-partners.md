## Swiss National Library, SNL.

[// www.nb.admin.ch](https://www.nb.admin.ch/?lang=en) &mdash; As a memory institution of the Swiss Confederation, the Swiss National Library (SNL) stands ready to address the digital reality and is willing to promote innovative digital scholarship practices. Since 2006, the SNL has been digitizing its collections and making them available online, with a strong emphasis on serials and the press, in great demand among users. In collaboration with cantonal libraries and publishers, the Swiss National Library has set up a platform for online newspapers in 2011: [Swiss press online, SPOL](www.swisspressar-chives.ch). She also actively supported the DHLAB's project around *Le Temps* digital archives which, among others, led to the new interface of the journal's historical archives, [www.letempsarchives.ch](www.letempsarchives.ch).

**Role**: SNL will provide the consortium with access to digitized newspapers and periodicals, will give information and comments on the current status and requirements of her platform, and give feedback on the prototypes developed by the consortium. The national library will also take part in workshops where infrastructure providers (libraries, archives), digital scholars (historians), and text miners will share and exchange experience and, overall, benefit from the enrichement of newspapers' content and from the availabity of open source prototypes.

**Participants**: Marie-Christine Doffey (Director), Liliane Regamey (Head of User Services)

## National Library of Luxembourg, BnL.

[// www.bnl.public.lu](http://www.bnl.public.lu/fr/index.html) &mdash;  The National Library of Luxembourg has been facing the digital challenge for more than a decade,  both as a heritage library and as coordinator and service provider of the bibnet.lu network of  Luxembourg libraries, including the library of the University of Luxembourg. The BnL has started  digitizing its heritage collections in 2002 and has since then continuously adapted its specifications
 and methods to the changing user requirements and available technologies.  Due to conservation issues and growing demand from researchers and the general public, the  digitization of the Luxembourg press had been prioritized. To date, 473.330 pages with text  recognition, with 3.200.000 articles, and 188.140 pages in image mode are available on BnL's website [www.eluxemburgensia.lu](www.eluxemburgensia.lu).


**Role**: The BnL will support the project by providing the enriched full text data of its digitized newspapers and periodicals collection, which spans the mid-19th to the 20th century. The BnL will share information on the development of its current portal,  its data enrichments aims and plans, as well as give feedback on the prototypes newly developed by the project. It hopes to identify opportunities for the improvement of its  existing portal, which is scheduled to undergo a technological and functional refresh. The BnL will additionally provide input about the process of re-integration of useful enrichments created by the project to its digital collections. The isntitution is ready to participate in workshops and conferences dealing with questions raised by the
Consortium's project.

**Participants**: Monique Kieffer (Director), Carlo Blum (?)

## State Archives of Valais, AEV.

## Le Temps

[// www.letemps.ch](https://www.letemps.ch/) &mdash;  *Le Temps*, the leading newspaper in French speaking Switzerland, was launched in march 1998. Its ancestors, the *Journal de Genève* and *La Gazette de Lausanne*, played an important role in the history of the region. Therefore, ten years ago, the direction of Le Temps has decided to digitize and make accessible its complete historical archive. The process involved the Swiss National Library,
several sponsors, and years of work. In 2016, the [www.letempsarchives.ch](www.letempsarchives.ch) website has been totally redesigned with one objective in mind: making this archive as accessible as possible to the general
audience.

**Role**: Le Temps will provide access to its digitized archives, and actively support the design of historical newspaper exploration interface by giving suggestions and feedback about functionalities. Le Temps will have the opportunity to enrich its newspaper archives's content with the output of text mining tools (e.g. named entities, document topics and more), and to create a match between innovative content access technology and user needs.

**Participants**: Gaël Hurlimann (Editor in Chief fo Digital)

## Neue Zürcher Zeitung, NZZ.

[// www.nzz.ch](https://www.nzz.ch/) &mdash; Since 1780 the NZZ provides to their readers mainly political and economic information. With the upcoming internet the NZZ started to develop digital information channels and is about to switch to a digital only product palette due to changed user behaviour. Part of this strategy was to transform the complete paper archive to digital (via scanning/OCR).

**Role**: NZZ supports impresso by  giving full access to all existing digital newpaper assets from 1780 to 1950 (strictly restricted to project internal distribution). NZZ will also provide the consortium with feedback on the status quo and desiderata of their current portals, and on prototypes that are newly developed by the consortium. The journal will have the possibility to access the improved text after applying automatic OCR post-correction and the enriched newspaper's content with the output of text mining tools. NZZ will also participate prominently in workshops where infrastructure providers (libraries, archives), digital scholars (historians), and text miners exchange.

**Participants**: Ruth Haener (Head of the Archive and Services Department), André Maerz (Project Manager for Convergence (? google translate...))


## History department, University of Lausanne, UNIL.

[// www.unil.ch/hist](http://www.unil.ch/hist/home.html) &mdash; Since more than a decade, the History Department has a strong expertise in media history and is actively engaged in research and teaching activities in DH in the frame of the development of a Competence Centre in Digital Humanities in partnership with the EPFL. Beyond history of the media themselves, our approach aims at an ever more systematic and methodologically rigorous integration of digital audiovisual and media sources into contemporary Swiss history.

**Role**: Historians from UNIL will use the tools and interfaces developed in the course of the project for teaching activities in the field of Media history, History of Swiss foreign policy and of International cultural relations, as well as political and cultural History of European integration (WP6.5). They will also study the epistemological and methodological implications inherent in the generation, analysis, and interpretation of text analysis tools,
interfaces, and visualizations, and will organize and contribute to workshops on these topics (WP6.4).

**Participants**: François Vallotton (Full professor and vice-dean of the Faculty of Arts), Raphaëlle Ruppen-Coutaz (Lecturer).

## infoclio

[// www.infoclio.ch](https://www.infoclio.ch/) &mdash; Infoclio.ch was created on the initiative of the Swiss History Society (SSH) and of the Swiss Academy of Humanities and Social Sciences (SSHU). Its objectives are to develop a digital infrastructure for the historical sciences in Switzerland, to coordinate its main actors and institutions, to increase the visibility of Swiss historical research in the digital context, and to facilitate access to digital and international programs for researchers.

**Role**: infoclio will work in close collaboration with the consortium for the achievement of tasks related to the interplay between computer scientists and historians, and related to the design and reception of digital interfaces for the exploration of historical data. More precisely, infoclio will participate to workshops where infrastructure providers (libraries, archives), digital scholars (historians), and text miners exchange. In this regard, the association will be responsible for the organisation and realisation of the second and fifth workshops on prototypes and epistemological issues, and of the sixth one on the final evaluation of the developed systems (see project timeline).
<!---Besides, inflocio will help to identify opportunities for the improvement of existing portals in order to promote innovative digital scholarship practices; support the investigation of the potentials of digital approaches; encourage the improvement of digital literacy; co-design computational tools for the exploration of historical sources, and identify and serve user needs.--->
