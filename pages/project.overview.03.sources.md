Our efforts will primarily focus on the digital archives of French and German newspapers in the 19th and (early) 20th centuries provided by our associated partners (LINK).

 The core set of sources is currently under development; more information will be posted on this early 2018.
In addition to our Swiss-Luxembourgish core set, we intend to incorporate other sources (in German, French, English and possibly Italian) from other institutions.
