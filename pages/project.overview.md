## Context


Historical newspapers are mirrors of past societies. Published over centuries on a regular basis, they record wars and minor events, report on international, national and local matters, and document the day-to-day life. In a word, they keep track of the great and small history, and the wealth of information they offer as well as their inherent contextualization makes them invaluable primary sources for historians.

For long held on library and archive shelving, newspapers are currently undergoing mass digitization, and millions of facsimiles, along with their machine-readable content acquired via Optical Character Recognition, are becoming accessible via a variety of online portals. If this represents a major step forward in terms of preservation of and access to documents, conducting research using these sources raises a number of problems, including a lack of text searchability as a result of poor text recognition and missing metadata, the relative isolation of digitised newspapers within their respective archives, search functions that are difficult to use, and poorly designed user interfaces.

However, recent progress in text analysis has also opened up new possibilities for conducting research on historical text collections. Opportunities include
enhanced analysis capacities, with the possibility to automatically explore the content of newspapers with an unprecedented speed-depth-volume combination, a greater scope, with the possibility to conduct global studies by comparing and contrasting viewpoints, and a larger continuity, with the possibility to consider the entire lifespan of newspapers or collections thereof in single studies. This is the route explored by the present project.

## Objectives

*Impresso* aims at enabling **new ways of engaging with digital historical newspaper content and new approaches to address historical questions**. To this end, the project will address the following main objectives:
<br><br>

### 1) Historical media monitoring tool suite

Our first objective is to develop **multilingual and time-specific text mining techniques to transform noisy and unstructured textual content into semantically indexed, structured, and linked data**. More specifically, we aim at building a set of NLP components for OCR post correction, n-gram indexing, distributional semantic indexing, named entity processing and text categorization and clustering.

The performance of these tools applied on historical texts will be **systematically assessed** through traditional summative evaluation using ground thruth references, and through formative evaluation with the collaboration of historians. Additionally, this evaluation initiative will be extended to other systems via the organization of a **shared task**.

Finally, structured data will be stored in a **fully traceable and interoperable historical semantic knowledge base**. Interoperability and transparency will support historiansâ€™ investigations and allow our partnering libraries to reintegrate our annotations into their production systems and thereby ensure the sustainability of our approach.

### 2) Visualization interfaces and visual analytics for content exploration

Our second objective corresponds the developement of a **visualization interface to enable the seamless exploration of complex and vast amounts of historical data**. This interface will integrate common search functionalities like keywords and faceted search but also, and most importantly, **novel functionalities to accomodate text analysis research tools and empower users to use the system in a reflexive way**.

The interface will, among others, give access to different entry points into the document collection, represent biases introduced by tools and gaps in the document collections, permit contrastive views of aggregated material, provide provenance and confidence level of annotations, and enable user-driven data curation.

Interface designers and developers will design and test the system in close cooperation with historians and computational linguists, **according to the principles of co-design**. This close cooperation will ensure that quality standards in each discipline are met, that the desired goals are achieved, that new opportunities are identified, and that problems will be spotted and solved early in the development process. This approach also ascertains that the system will have an adequate learning curve for end users. They will aslo

### 3) Digital History

As a necessary complement to the first two objectives dedicated to digital implementation aspects, our third objective relates to the usage and impact of the developed tools.

First, developing computational systems to support historical research raises numerous **methodological and epistemological questions**. In this regard, historians will first consider the question of **source criticism**, examining the biases of 'digital blind spots' introduced by digitization, exploring the problem of considering digital and non-digital material in a combined approach, and investigating the difficulty of source contextualization in a digital landscape where spatial and institutional boundaries are less prominent. We will also consider the question of **digital scholarship**, or how (digital) history needs to devised new ways of using what computer science can offer, as well as the imperative need of how to train future digital historians, based on the direct usage of _Impresso_ tools in the classroom.

Second, the strengths and weaknesses of new tools and methods are best evaluated when they are put to productive use. **Resistance against Europe** will be our dedicated **historical use case**. Designed to benefit from the text analysis and visualization components, this research work will deliver continued feedback on their viability for historical research.

## Primary sources

Our efforts will primarily focus on digital archives of French and German newspapers of the 19<sup>th</sup> and (first half of) 20<sup>th</sup> centuries provided by our associated partners (LINK). The core set is under construction and more information will be posted on this early 2018.

In addition to our Swiss-Luxembourgish core set, we intend to incorporate other sources (in German, French, English, and possibly Italian) from other instituations.
