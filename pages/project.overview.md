## Context


Historical newspapers are mirrors of past societies which keep track of the great and small history. Published over centuries on a regular basis, they record wars and minor events, report on international, national and local matters, and document the day-to-day life. The wealth of information they offer as well as their inherent contextualization makes them invaluable primary sources for historians.

For long held on library and archive shelving, newspapers are currently undergoing mass digitization, and millions of facsimiles, along with their machine-readable content acquired via Optical Character Recognition, are becoming accessible via a variety of online portals. If this represents a major step forward in terms of preservation of and access to documents, conducting research using these sources raises a number of problems, including a lack of text searchability as a result of poor text recognition and missing metadata, the relative isolation of digitised newspapers within their respective archives, search functions that are difficult to use, and poorly designed user interfaces. Recent progress in text analysis has also opened up new possibilities for conducting research on large collections of texts.
