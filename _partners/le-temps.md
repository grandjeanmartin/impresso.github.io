[// www.letemps.ch](https://www.letemps.ch/) &mdash;  *Le Temps*, the leading newspaper in French speaking Switzerland, was launched in march 1998. Its ancestors, the *Journal de Genève* and *La Gazette de Lausanne*, played an important role in the history of the region in the last 200 years, with the first archive dating back to 1 Feb 1789. Therefore, ten years ago, the direction of Le Temps has decided to digitize and make accessible its full historical archives. The process involved the Swiss National Library,
several sponsors, and years of work. In 2016, the [www.letempsarchives.ch](www.letempsarchives.ch) website has been totally redesigned with one objective in mind: making archives as accessible as possible to the general audience.

**Role**: Le Temps will provide access to its digitized archives, and actively support the design of historical newspaper exploration interface by giving suggestions and feedback on prototypes developed by the consortium.

**Participants**: Gaël Hurlimann (Editor in Chief fo Digital)
