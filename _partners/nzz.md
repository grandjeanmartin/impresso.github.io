[// www.nzz.ch](https://www.nzz.ch/) &mdash; Since 1780 the NZZ provides to their readers mainly political and economic information. With the upcoming internet the NZZ started to develop digital information channels and is about to switch to a digital only product palette due to changed user behaviour. Part of this strategy was to transform the complete paper archive to digital (via scanning/OCR).

**Role**: NZZ supports impresso by  giving full access to all existing digital newpaper assets from 1780 to 1950 (strictly restricted to project internal distribution). NZZ will also provide the consortium with feedback on the status quo and desiderata of their current portals, and on prototypes that are newly developed by the consortium. The journal will have the possibility to access the improved text after applying automatic OCR post-correction and the enriched newspaper's content with the output of text mining tools. NZZ will also participate prominently in workshops where infrastructure providers (libraries, archives), digital scholars (historians), and text miners exchange.

**Participants**: Ruth Haener (Head of the Archive and Services Department), André Maerz (Project Manager for Convergence (? google translate...))
