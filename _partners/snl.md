[www.nb.admin.ch](https://www.nb.admin.ch/?lang=en) &mdash; As a memory institution of the Swiss Confederation, the Swiss National Library (SNL) stands ready to address the digital reality and is willing to promote innovative digital scholarship practices. Since 2006, the SNL has been digitizing its collections and making them available online, with a strong emphasis on serials and the press, in great demand among users. In collaboration with cantonal libraries and publishers, the Swiss National Library has set up a platform for online newspapers in 2011: [Swiss press online, SPOL](www.swisspressar-chives.ch). She also actively supported the DHLAB's project around *Le Temps* digital archives which, among others, led to the new interface of the journal's historical archives, [www.letempsarchives.ch](www.letempsarchives.ch).

**Role**: SNL will provide the consortium with access to digitized newspapers and periodicals, will give information and comments on the current status and requirements of her platform, and give feedback on the prototypes developed by the consortium. The national library will also take part in workshops where infrastructure providers (libraries, archives), digital scholars (historians), and text miners will share and exchange experience and, overall, benefit from the enrichement of newspapers' content and from the availabity of open source prototypes.

**Participants**: Marie-Christine Doffey (Director), Liliane Regamey (Head of User Services)
