[www.infoclio.ch](https://www.infoclio.ch/) &mdash; infoclio.ch is the professional portal for the historical sciences in Switzerland. It was created on the initiative of the Swiss History Society (SSH) and of the Swiss Academy of Humanities and Social Sciences (SAHS). Its objectives are to develop a digital infrastructure for the historical sciences in Switzerland, to increase the visibility of Swiss historical research on the Web, and to facilitate access to digital tools and methods for researchers in the humanities.

**Role**: infoclio will work in close collaboration with the consortium for the achievement of tasks related to the interplay between computer scientists and historians, and related to the design and reception of digital interfaces for the exploration of historical data. More precisely, infoclio will participate to workshops where infrastructure providers (libraries, archives), digital scholars (historians), and text miners exchange. In this regard, the organization will be responsible for the organisation and realisation of the second and fifth workshops on prototypes and epistemological issues, and of the sixth one on the final evaluation of the developed systems (see project timeline).

<!---Besides, infoclio will help to identify opportunities for the improvement of existing portals in order to promote innovative digital scholarship practices; support the investigation of the potentials of digital approaches; encourage the improvement of digital literacy; co-design computational tools for the exploration of historical sources, and identify and serve user needs.-->

**Participants**: Enrico Natale (Managing Director)
