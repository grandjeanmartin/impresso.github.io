[// www.unil.ch/hist](http://www.unil.ch/hist/home.html) &mdash; Since more than a decade, the History Department has a strong expertise in media history and is actively engaged in research and teaching activities in digital humanities. Beyond history of the media themselves, the department aims at an ever more systematic and methodologically rigorous integration of digital audiovisual and media sources into contemporary Swiss history.

**Role**: Historians from UNIL will use the tools and interfaces developed in the course of the project for teaching activities in the field of media history, history of swiss foreign policy and of international cultural relations, as well as political and cultural history of european integration (WP6.5). They will also contribute to the reflection on the epistemological and methodological implications of the usage of text analysis tools, interfaces, and visualizations, and will organize and contribute to workshops on these topics (WP6.4).

**Participants**: François Vallotton (Full professor and vice-dean of the Faculty of Arts), Raphaëlle Ruppen Coutaz (Lecturer).
