[// www.unil.ch/hist](http://www.unil.ch/hist/home.html) &mdash;  For more than a decade, the University of Lausanne’s History Department has developed extensive expertise in media history and has been actively engaged in research and teaching activities in digital humanities. As well as exploring the history of the media, the department encourages the increasingly systematic and methodologically rigorous integration of digital audiovisual and media sources into contemporary Swiss history.

**Role**: Historians from UNIL will use the tools and interfaces developed in the course of the project for teaching activities in the field of media history, the history of Swiss foreign policy and international cultural relations, as well as the political and cultural history of European integration (WP6.5). They will also contribute to discussions on the epistemological and methodological implications of the use of text analysis tools, interfaces and visualisations, and will organise and contribute to workshops on these topics (WP6.4).
**Participants**: François Vallotton (Full Professor and Vice-Dean of the Faculty of Arts), Raphaëlle Ruppen Coutaz (Lecturer).
